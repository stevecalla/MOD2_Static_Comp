## Overview

The static comp challenge is a challenge to get you working that HTML/CSS muscle. :muscle: You will be asked to recreate a webpage based off of the provided static comp. Don’t worry, we’ll give you a bit of creative license, however the objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design. Once you get into the workforce - building out comps that reflect the designer’s choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail is a requirement.
